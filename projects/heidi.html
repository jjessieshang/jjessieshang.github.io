            <p class="body-text"><strong>The Problem </strong><br>
                Prehospital telemedicine triage systems combined with machine learning methods have 
                the potential to improve accuracy and safely redirect low-acuity patients from attending the emergency 
                department (ED). However, research in prehospital settings is limited while ED overcrowding and 
                adverse patient outcomes are on the rise. 
            </p>
            <p class="body-text"><strong>Our Solution </strong><br>
                In this scoping review, we sought to characterize the current 
                state of ML-enhanced methods applied to prehospital telemedicine emergency triage without the use of 
                physical assessments. Overall, the most popular ML algorithm was support vector machine (SVM; n=8, 53%) 
                and tree-based methods, including random forest (RF; n=6, 40%) and extreme gradient boosting 
                (XGBoost; n=4, 27%). Other popular algorithms were neural networks (NN; n=5, 33%), with various 
                implementations observed, such as deep NNs, bidirectional long short-term memory models, and ensemble 
                of deep learning networks. <br>
    
                In addition to identifying 11 key predictors to the remote pre-hospital triage process, we present analysis of subjectivity 
                in ML systems and underscore the need for nuance regarding objectivity and ground truth.
