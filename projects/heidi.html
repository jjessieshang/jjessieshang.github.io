        <p>Problem: Prehospital telemedicine triage systems combined with machine learning methods have 
            the potential to improve accuracy and safely redirect low-acuity patients from attending the emergency 
            department (ED). However, research in prehospital settings is limited while ED overcrowding and 
            adverse patient outcomes are common. 
        </p>
        <p>Solution: <br>
            In this scoping review, we sought to characterize the current 
            state of ML-enhanced methods applied to prehospital telemedicine emergency triage without the use of 
            physical assessments. Overall, the most popular ML algorithm was support vector machine (SVM; n=8, 53%) 
            and tree-based methods, including random forest (RF; n=6, 40%) and extreme gradient boosting 
            (XGBoost; n=4, 27%). Other popular algorithms were neural networks (NN; n=5, 33%), with various 
            implementations observed, such as deep NNs, bidirectional long short-term memory models, and ensemble 
            of deep learning networks. <br>

            In addition to identifying 11 key predictors to the remote pre-hospital triage process, we present analysis of subjectivity 
            in ML systems and underscore the need for nuance regarding objectivity and ground truth.
